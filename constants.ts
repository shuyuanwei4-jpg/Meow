      zh: "缅因没有悲惨的过去。\n\n他是一只被好好爱过的猫。他的主人是一个叫小林的女孩，养了他整整八年。小林每天给他梳毛，给他拍照片发朋友圈，叫他\"我儿子\"。\n\n上个月，小林确诊了一种需要长期住院治疗的病。她不知道自己什么时候能出院，也不知道还能不能继续养猫。\n\n她花了一个星期，给缅因写了一份详细的\"使用手册\"：\n\n\"他早上六点会饿，要先给湿粮再给干粮。\"\n\"他怕打雷，打雷的时候要抱着他。\"\n\"他喜欢被摸下巴，但不喜欢被摸肚子。\"\n\"他洗澡的时候会很凶，但其实他不会咬人，只是在虚张声势。\"\n\"他是全世界最好的猫。\"\n\"拜托你们，帮他找一个好的家。\"\n\n那份手册有整整四页。\n\n小林把缅因送来的时候没有哭。她把他抱得很紧，在他耳朵边说了很长很长的话。然后她松手了。\n\n缅因回头看了三次。\n\n他不配合洗澡——不是因为害怕，不是因为愤怒。是因为他觉得：如果我表现得很乖，你们是不是就会把我送走？\n\n他不想再被送走了。他想让所有人觉得他很难搞，这样就没人会领养他，他就可以一直待在这里，等小林来接他。\n\n……\n\n缅因，你不知道的是，小林每天都会打电话来问你的情况。",
      en: "Maine was loved. His owner, Lin, raised him for eight years. She brushed him daily and called him \"my son\".\n\nLast month, Lin was hospitalized indefinitely. She didn't know if she could keep him.\n\nShe wrote a four-page manual:\n\n\"He eats at 6 AM.\"\n\"He's scared of thunder.\"\n\"He loves chin scratches.\"\n\"He acts tough in the bath, but won't bite.\"\n\"He is the best cat in the world.\"\n\"Please find him a good home.\"\n\nLin didn't cry when she dropped him off. She hugged him tight, whispered to him, and let go.\n\nMaine looked back three times.\n\nHe fights the bath not because he's mad, but because he thinks: If I'm bad, maybe they won't adopt me out. Maybe I can stay here until Lin comes back.\n\n...Maine, you don't know this, but Lin calls every day to check on you."
